# Exploration of the Subjective Comparative Relation Quintuples Dataset (SCRQD)

## Introduction to the SCRQD Dataset
The Subjective Comparative Relation Quintuples Dataset (SCRQD) is an innovative resource designed for the nuanced analysis of subjective comparative questions in the smartphone domain. SCRQD stands out for its detailed categorization and unique approach to understanding the subtleties of comparative queries, thereby enhancing the capabilities of Automatic Subjective Question Answering (ASQA) systems.

## An Overview of the SCRQD Dataset
SCRQD is a meticulously curated collection of 1,275 questions, each annotated to unravel the complexities of subjective comparisons. This dataset is renowned for its depth and precision in categorization, providing an invaluable tool for researchers and developers in ASQA.

## Main Classification Task in SCRQD
SCRQD focuses on the extraction of Subjective Comparative Relation Quintuples from each question, encompassing:

- Subject Entity
- Object Entity
- Compared Aspect
- Constraint
- Preference

These elements collectively offer a comprehensive perspective on the nature of comparisons in questions, facilitating a deeper understanding of user preferences and inquiries within the smartphone domain.

## Diving Deeper: Exploring the Subtasks in SCRQD
The dataset includes several vital subtasks, each contributing to a thorough understanding of the questions:

1. **Element Extraction**: Identifying key components of the questions, such as entities, aspects, and constraints.
2. **Entity Role Identification**: Categorizing the roles of entities as subjects or objects in the comparative narrative.
3. **Comparative Preference Classification**: Classifying the type of preference expressed in the questions.
